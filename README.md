This repository serves as a comprehensive guide to Object-Oriented Programming concepts. It includes theoretical explanations, practical examples, and code snippets to help learners grasp the fundamentals of OOP and apply them in real-world scenarios.

## OOP Concepts

### Class
A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines a set of attributes (data) and methods (functions) that the created objects will have.

### Object
An object is an instance of a class. It contains data and methods that operate on that data.

### Encapsulation
Encapsulation is the bundling of data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit (class). It restricts direct access to some of the object's components, promoting data hiding.

### Inheritance
Inheritance allows a new class to inherit properties and methods from an existing class. This promotes code reusability and establishes a relationship between classes.

### Polymorphism
Polymorphism allows methods to do different things based on the object it is acting upon. It can be achieved through method overriding and method overloading.

### Abstraction
Abstraction is the concept of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of the object. It helps in reducing programming complexity.
